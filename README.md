Personal Setup Configs

1. Move everything into your home directory and unzip
2. Make install.sh executeable by running the command "chmod +x install.sh". Then run "./install.sh".
3. Open lxappearance, make any kind of change (it really doesn't matter what type of change as long as something is changed), then go to your home directory and type "ll" to find the ".gtkrc-2.0" file and then open it with nano (or your editor of choice), change the gtk-font-name to your font of choosing (in my case it is "VeraMono 8"). Now type "nano .config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini" and change the gtk-font-name to your font of choosing (VeraMono 8). Then restart lxapperance and it should appear as your choosen setting, just don't change it or else you have to start all over again.
4. Open Firefox and change theme to "Tron-ish"
5. Open lxappearance and choose the arc theme and logo theme.
6. Customize Terminal to personal liking with font with I-Beam, no custom font, custom color scheme with #6FC3DF as text color, #0C141F as background color, and Palette entry 11 as #E6FFFF
7. Download CTLVisualizer from https://github.com/dpayne/cli-visualizer and follow instructions. Then move their configs in to their config locations.
8. Find Atom on Github and follow instructions to download it.
9. Press "Crtl+Shift+r" to reload your i3 then logout ("Crtl+Shift+e") and back in for extra measure.
10. Configure what is left.
